        LEADING THE KPOP’S 4TH GENERATION DANCE GROUP
      </h2>
      <h3 id="Cont2">
        ITZY came from JYP Entertainment, the home to one of the biggest names in the industry, Twice. In contrast to their sister group, the girls are the current princesses of the teen crush concept. Singing about being secure in who you are and loving your current self, ITZY are important to the teens of Korea and globally. Debuting under the same agency as one of South Korea’s biggest female exports, there was a sense of pressure for them to live up to JYP’s history of strong girl groups. Only one year into their career. ITZY are carving their own place in JYP history and becoming one of the most exciting groups of the fourth generation of KPOP.
